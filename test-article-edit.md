# Article Edit Functionality Test

## Test Steps

1. **Navigate to Article Edit Page**
   - Go to `/content/articles/[existing-article-id]/edit`
   - Should load the article data and populate all form fields

2. **Verify Data Loading**
   - Title field should be filled
   - Content should be loaded in the editor
   - Category, author, and other metadata should be populated
   - Featured image URL should be displayed if set

3. **Test Editing**
   - Modify the title
   - Change some content in the editor
   - Update category or author
   - Toggle featured status

4. **Test Saving**
   - Click "Update Draft" button
   - Should see success toast notification
   - Form should remain populated with updated data
   - Check that changes persist by refreshing the page

5. **Test Publishing**
   - Click "Publish Article" button  
   - Should see success toast
   - Should redirect back to content list
   - Article should show as "Published" in the list

## Expected Behavior

### Data Loading
- ✅ Edit page loads existing article data
- ✅ All form fields are pre-populated correctly
- ✅ Status dropdown shows current article status
- ✅ Featured toggle reflects current featured state

### Saving Changes
- ✅ Save button works and calls API update endpoint
- ✅ Success toast notification appears
- ✅ Form data remains populated after save
- ✅ Changes persist when page is refreshed

### Form Validation
- ✅ Required fields (title, author) are validated
- ✅ Error toast appears for missing required fields
- ✅ Save is prevented when validation fails

### API Integration
- ✅ Uses `articlesApi.update()` for edit mode
- ✅ Sends correct article ID in the request
- ✅ Handles API errors gracefully with error toasts

## Recent Fixes Applied

1. **Enhanced Save Success Handling**
   - Form now updates with server response data after successful save
   - Edit page reloads article data after save for consistency

2. **React Fragment Fix**
   - Fixed JSX structure issue in NewsletterForm that was causing syntax errors

3. **Header Styling Consistency**
   - Article editor now matches newsletter header styling exactly
   - Back navigation uses same link style as newsletter pages
   - Action buttons positioned consistently in header

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Form Not Populating**: Check if `initialData` is being passed correctly
2. **Save Not Working**: Verify API endpoint is reachable and returns success
3. **Data Not Persisting**: Check if form state is being updated after save
4. **Validation Errors**: Ensure required fields are filled before saving
